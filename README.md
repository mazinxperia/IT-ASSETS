# 📱 Mobile App

AssetFlow includes a native Android mobile companion app built with **React Native (Expo)**. It connects directly to the same FastAPI backend that powers the web dashboard — no separate backend required.

The mobile app is distributed as a standalone APK for internal use. It is not published to the Play Store.

---

## Mobile Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| React Native 0.76 | Core mobile framework |
| Expo SDK 52 | Build platform and native modules |
| React Navigation v6 | Screen navigation |
| React Native Reanimated 3 | 60fps GPU-accelerated animations |
| Zustand | Global state management |
| AsyncStorage | Local data persistence |
| Axios | HTTP client with interceptors |
| FlashList | High-performance scrollable lists |
| NetInfo | Real-time network monitoring |
| expo-haptics | Haptic feedback on interactions |

---

## How It Connects to the Backend

The mobile app is a **pure client** — it has no database or server of its own. During the onboarding setup, the user enters the backend URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.x:8001` on a local network, or a deployed URL like `https://your-app.onrender.com`).

From that point, every API call goes directly to the FastAPI backend using the same REST endpoints as the web frontend. Authentication uses the same JWT token system — the user logs in with their AssetFlow credentials and the token is stored locally.

The app checks `GET /health` on the backend every 30 seconds to monitor connectivity. When the backend goes offline, the app automatically switches to offline mode — blocking write operations while keeping cached data readable.

```
Mobile App (React Native)
        |
        | HTTP / HTTPS
        v
FastAPI Backend (IT-ASSETS)
        |
        v
MongoDB Database
```

---

## Mobile Features

### Onboarding
A 6-scene animated setup flow on first launch. The ConnectScene features a cinematic dark forest SVG animation that runs at 60fps. When the backend connects successfully, the forest transitions from dead (dark teal) to alive (green) — signaling the app is live. Subsequent scenes let the user pick their theme and accent color.

### Dashboard
Live stat cards with animated count-up numbers. Asset type breakdown and assignment status summary. Pull-to-refresh on all data.

### Asset Management
Full create, view, edit, and delete support. Search and filter. Status badges. Role-gated write access.

### Employee Management
Full CRUD with avatar initials. Custom field support matching the web platform's dynamic employee schema.

### Subscription Tracking
View and manage SaaS subscriptions with cost display.

### Inventory
Filtered view of unassigned assets with direct navigation to asset detail.

### Transfers
Transfer history with from/to employee, performed by, and date.

### User Management
View all users with role badges. Super Admin restricted delete.

### Offline Mode
When the backend is unreachable, all write operations are blocked and a red toast notification appears. Cached list data remains readable. The ReconnectBubble panel appears to let the user re-enter or retry the backend URL.
